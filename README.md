"# End-to-End-ML-Project---IPL-First-Innings-Score-Prediction" 

This is the sample project here i done some preprocessing steps and building multiple model to analysis which model accuracy is good. 

Finally Ridge Regression Model accuracy is good. 

So I done the sample frontend to show case this project. 

here we give some of the parameters to predict the first innings score(eg : Batting Team, Bowling Team, Last five over score, Last five over wickets etc.,.).
